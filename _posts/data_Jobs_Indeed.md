> "Why search manually when you can let Python do the heavy lifting?"

This project demonstrates building a web scraper using Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries to fetch data analyst job listings from Indeed. The scraper extracts job details for the Toronto region and exports the data into a CSV file for further analysis, with location customization options.
